# CAMMU
Universal multi material filament system, inspired by ERCF and tradrack systems but designed to use no servo at all and keep components as accessible as possible.

A full custome controller and DIY controller is currently in the works and to be released soon. 2 stepper ports and 6 endstop connections are all that is needed if you build the 4 gate version.

Please feel free to contribute towards future projects and developments
